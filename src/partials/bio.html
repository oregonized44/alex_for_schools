        Thank you for taking the time to drop by. I want to bridge the gap between schools, families, business. Focus on drop out rates starting with middle school students. Giving kids an opportunity/ option to strengthan skills. Build a bond/bridge/partnership between parents/students/ local companies. Can be persuasive and able to connect with kids, parents, local companies, via friendships.
